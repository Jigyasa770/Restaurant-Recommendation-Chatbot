# Restaurant-Recommendation-Chatbot
 This Python script implements a basic chatbot that recommends restaurants based on user input using simple rule-based methods.
Overview
This project is a simple Python script that implements a chatbot capable of recommending restaurants based on user input. The chatbot utilizes natural language processing techniques to preprocess user input and selects a restaurant recommendation using a basic rule-based approach.

Features
Preprocesses user input to remove stop words and non-alphanumeric characters.
Recommends a restaurant based on a simple rule-based method (random selection).
Interactive user interface for input and recommendation display.
Easily extensible for further enhancements and integration with more sophisticated recommendation algorithms.
Requirements
Python 3.x
NLTK library
